1) The folder contains the model.txt file, my_result (the result file after training and testing) and the train.py and test.py files
2) It asks for the name of the test file, this test file should be placed in the same folder as the one in which you put the train.py and test.py files. 
3) So basically put all the model.txt,tarin.py and test.py files all in one folder, for the program to work.
